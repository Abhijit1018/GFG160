## What was fixed

The deployment issue was that platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel look for an `index.html` file as the entry point. Without it, they might serve the README file instead.

**Solution implemented:**
- âœ… Created `index.html` as the main landing page
- âœ… Added responsive design showcasing all DSA solutions
- âœ… Organized content by topics with problem counts
- âœ… Added navigation and links to your profiles
- âœ… Included deployment configuration files
- âœ… Made the actual code files accessible and viewable

Now when deployed, visitors will see a beautiful portfolio showcasing your DSA journey instead of just the README file!
